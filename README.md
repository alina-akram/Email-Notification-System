# Implementation

• How flexible is your implementation?

This application creates and sends out appropriate emails to a specific type of customer at runtime based on type. Due to the simple implementation the Main.java file demonstrates specific customers getting added to each customer type and the factories send out the appropriate email. 


• How is the simplicity and understandability of your implementation?

It's a flexibile implementation where new types of customers can be made given the subclass extends the Email class. New Email types can be made if it implements the EmailFactory. It is a very straightforward implementation. As of now each instance of a customer is instantiated under each factory implementation. The Email.java file gets the necessary details which are passed into the respective factory (implementing EmailFactory) which generates the appropriate email.
Future implementation will have a more extensive customer registration process which can be filtered by type during runtime. 


• How you avoided duplicated code?
Due to the simple implementation, we were able to limit duplicate code to a degree.

# Project Template

This is a Java Maven Project Template


# How to compile the project

We use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. 

You need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  on your system. 

Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

# How to create a binary runnable package 


```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```


# How to run

```bash
mvn -q clean compile exec:java -Dexec.executable="edu.bu.met.cs665.Main" -Dlog4j.configuration="file:log4j.properties"
```

We recommand the above command for running the project. 

Alternativly, you can run the following command. It will generate a single jar file with all of the dependencies. 

```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single

java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties -classpath ./target/JavaProjectTemplate-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  edu.bu.met.cs665.Main
```


# Run all the unit test classes.


```bash
mvn clean compile test

```

# Using Findbugs 

To see bug detail using the Findbugs GUI, use the following command "mvn findbugs:gui"

Or you can create a XML report by using  


```bash
mvn findbugs:gui 
```

or 


```bash
mvn findbugs:findbugs
```


For more info about FindBugs see 

http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/

And about Maven Findbug plugin see 
https://gleclaire.github.io/findbugs-maven-plugin/index.html


You can install Findbugs Eclipse Plugin 

http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/eclipse.html



SpotBugs https://spotbugs.github.io/ is the spiritual successor of FindBugs.


# Run Checkstyle 

CheckStyle code styling configuration files are in config/ directory. Maven checkstyle plugin is set to use google code style. 
You can change it to other styles like sun checkstyle. 

To analyze this example using CheckStyle run 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

This will generate a report in XML format


```bash
target/checkstyle-checker.xml
target/checkstyle-result.xml
```

and the following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open it using a Web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

```bash
target/site/checkstyle.html
```


# Generate  coveralls:report 

You can find more info about coveralls 

https://coveralls.io/

```bash
mvn -DrepoToken=YOUR-REPO-TOCKEN-ON-COVERALLS  cobertura:cobertura coveralls:report
```
